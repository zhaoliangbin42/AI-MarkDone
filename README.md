## 🤔 Is This For You?

- Do you often get frustrated because **copied math formulas always turn out incorrect**?
- Do you frequently need to copy **single math formulas** within a paragraph separately?
- Do you often want to **copy only a specific section** instead of the entire response?
- Do you frequently find it difficult to read an entire section due to some unrendered formulas on the page (especially **Deep Research** long outputs), making you want to smash your computer?

If any of these pain points resonate with you, this extension is an absolute must-have. 😉

## ✨ Features at a Glance

### 📐 Click-to-Copy Math Formulas

- Supports click-to-copy for single formulas **even during real-time streaming output**.
- Automatically extracts LaTeX formulas from AI responses.
- Supports both **inline formulas** (`$...$`) and **block formulas** (`$$...$$`).
- The copied content is directly compatible with popular Markdown editors like Typora and Obsidian.

### 🧾 One-Click Formatted Copy for ChatGPT & Gemini Dialogues (Markdown)

- One-click copy of the **Markdown source** for the current complete dialogue.
- Automatically wraps formulas using `$.$` and `$$.$$`.
- Attempts to re-wrap formulas enclosed by `\[...\]`, `\(...\)` with `$...$` and `$$...$$`.
- Automatically removes citation markers, hyperlinks, and other noisy content generated by ChatGPT or Gemini, resulting in cleaner Markdown.

### 🪟 Markdown Source Display Panel

- **Directly displays** the Markdown source of the current dialogue in a panel format.
- Copy exactly what you want by free selection or segment copying.
- Ideal for scenarios where you only need to copy "a small segment."

### 🔄 Live Preview Real-time Re-rendering

- After parsing the Markdown, it is **re-rendered** within the panel.
- Provides a "reading experience reset" for "disaster areas" like **Deep Research** long texts, or complex mixtures of formulas, tables, and text.
- Crucially, even if some formulas fail to render or appear heavily highlighted in the original page, the preview area renders them correctly.
- Supports **fullscreen display** for focused reading without the page distraction.

### 📊 Word & Character Count (Precise CJK Handling)

- Special handling for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK): `1 CJK character = 1 word + 2 chars`.
- Real-time statistics for the current dialogue's word and character count.
- Automatically excludes content like code blocks and math formulas for a count closer to the actual "body length."
