# Current Test Gates

This document defines the **current executable test and verification gates** for day-to-day development. Use this file for what we must run now, not for future-state testing architecture.

For long-term testing direction, see `docs/testing/TESTING_BLUEPRINT.md`.
For full manual regression, see `docs/testing/E2E_REGRESSION_GUIDE.md`.

---

## 1. Document Roles

- `CURRENT_TEST_GATES.md`
  - current required verification for active development
- `TESTING_BLUEPRINT.md`
  - target testing architecture and future structure
- `E2E_REGRESSION_GUIDE.md`
  - full manual regression checklist for release or major refactor

---

## 2. Minimum Automated Gates

### Code Changes

Default minimum gate:

- `npm run build`

This is the repository-wide required proof for repo-tracked code changes unless the user explicitly waives it.

### Contract, Runtime, Or Boundary Changes

If the change affects protocol, storage, adapter contracts, runtime boundaries, or release/build gates, run:

- `npm run test:smoke`
- `npm run build`

### Broad Behavior Changes Or Risky Refactors

If the change touches multiple modules, user-visible flows, or high-risk paths, run:

- `npm run test:core`
- `npm run build`

Use targeted tests in addition when the failure mode is local and well defined.

### Bug Fixes

For testable bugs:

- add a failing reproducer test first
- run the relevant targeted test until it fails for the expected reason
- fix the implementation
- rerun the targeted test
- finish with `npm run build`

If the bug affects shared behavior or a critical path, also run `npm run test:smoke` or `npm run test:core` as appropriate.

## 3. Manual Gates

Manual regression is required when:

- preparing a release
- adding or expanding platform support
- changing UI injection, toolbar behavior, reader behavior, bookmarks flows, or browser compatibility boundaries
- changing style-system rules, Tailwind alias boundaries, or overlay/toolbar UI architecture

Use:

- `docs/testing/E2E_REGRESSION_GUIDE.md`

For new UI modules or major UI refactors, manual regression now also includes the mock-first visual gate:

- build a real mounted mock in `mocks/components/<module>/index.html`
- open it in a browser and validate light/dark, key interaction states, dual-instance rendering, and live `shadowRoot` style nodes
- keep screenshot or snapshot evidence before merging the implementation into `src/ui/**`
- if the change introduces or modifies an overlay host/runtime boundary, also validate:
  - backdrop / surface / modal layering
  - repeated open/close stability
  - modal stacking and ESC routing
  - both Chromium-style shared stylesheet and Firefox-style fallback paths

---

## 4. Recommended Gate Selection

- Docs-only changes
  - no automated test gate required unless a test/document contract changes
- UI workflow or style-system policy changes
  - update the relevant docs and call out the new mock-first/browser validation expectation explicitly
- Localized implementation change
  - targeted tests + `npm run build`
- Shared contract or boundary change
  - `npm run test:smoke` + `npm run build`
- High-risk or cross-module change
  - `npm run test:core` + `npm run build`
- Release preparation
  - `npm run test:smoke` + `npm run test:core` + `npm run build` + relevant manual regression

---

## 5. Done Criteria

Verification is complete only when:

- the selected automated gates actually ran
- the results are stated explicitly
- any required manual regression is called out
- remaining edge cases and recommended follow-up tests are made explicit
